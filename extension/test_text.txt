The heroine of this story is Casey. She’s an actress and a drama queen, but her husband is the real bitch. He is very particular about important dates. So when she awoke on the morning of his birthday, her side of their queen-size bed was wet. Not damp. Utterly drenched as in impregnated with sweat from their mum-patterned sheets down to the springs of their mattress. It was so noticeable that even Kerry, on the dry side, was beside himself.

“Aaaah fuck. This just keeps getting worse!” he moaned. He had taken precautions, or rather, he had their cleaning lady obtain linens of highest thread count in order to keep the sweat from wicking in under him and through his boxer-briefs. The nurse was specifically instructed to witness his woman urinating before she retired for the night. Though, he had once caught the retarded footman on his cell phone, likely speaking to that slutty daughter of his. That layman was yakking far too loudly in his mother tongue to have possibly confirmed the pissing sound through the thick beechwood door to the ladies' room. Why they had to install segregated bathrooms in their home was a mystery that the construction foreman had gone out of his way to question. That handyman just did not understand the acumen of the genius architect he had hired. They had met because she was a girlfriend of a fraternity brother, back when the frat house gave a shit about brotherhood. Since freshman year, the sheer bromance amongst the dudes was off the charts. Those guys were pretty baller. The girl might as well have been dating the whole gang of boys. Even then, that chick was always working like a slave, but she’s now all grown up as a decent businesswoman while maintaining her girlish charm and excellent hostess skills. What a woman. And her Paris-Brest pastries were killer.

“Damn, I should call her,” he noted to himself.

"Mum’s the word,” she promised last time they spoke about their affair. “If anyone finds out, tell him I’ll pay him off.” Anyway, he had to stuff naughty thoughts, the ones where his lady friend’s face is superimposed on a whore’s pussy, back into a fat mental chest drawer while he dealt with his wife:
“What? Did the bogeywoman get to you?” He imagined she must see herself a damsel in distress.

“Shh! We’ll wake the landlord,” Casey moaned, “Oh wait, we are the feudal barons of this lordly manor. May our forefathers lament our predicament. What malady have I thus contracted.” Her mental cameraman panned to a first person view. Jesus Christ, she hasn’t perspired this much since the delivery of her maternal twins. Or was it the eve of the paternity test? Wait, is it her period? Her menstrual cycle is logged per diem in her GirlyGirl app, but she’s such a ditz about it that she hasn’t even read the man page. At least her superman husband has his aunt, the janitress, monitor the laundry for stained granny panties and the trashman for pads and tampons… or at least she suspects as much. She would check herself, but she’s just a blind, deaf-mute cripple. Oh and she’s late for her stuntwoman master class on "How to look realistic while being carried by a fireman,” so she’s never going to be the frontwoman for mankind’s best band, like she’s always wanted to be.

With a pop, the BBC anchorwoman suddenly appeared on the TV. With the grace of a clergywoman, the charisma of a saleswoman, and the diction of a good mummy, she announced the interview of their motherland’s First Lady, Mrs. Obama. The reporter was a manly chap with a cowboy lilt, a pizza delivery boy cap, and a man purse, “Fellows of the network, ladies and gentlemen, y'all are about to hear what our assemblywomen have been kvetching about all morning:

'She made her remarks during a commencement speech at Tuskegee University over the weekend, comparing her experience as the wife of the first African-American president to the experiences of historical civil-rights leaders.
The First Lady recalled her experience on the campaign trail, accusing the media of giving her unique attention thanks to the “fears and misperceptions of others” who questioned whether she was “too loud, or too angry, or too emasculating.”'"

Meanwhile, their little boy played hangman with his barbie doll, spelling out caveman grunts.
