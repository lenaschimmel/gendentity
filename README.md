# gendentity
Let your software support a diverse range of gender identities and pronouns in its language and data.

Currently, there is only a small number of files in the repo, but we start to collect information and ideas [in the wiki](https://github.com/lenaschimmel/gendentity/wiki).

_This project was started at the CCCamp 2015 in the Queer Feminist Geek Village and made some progress during the 32C3._
